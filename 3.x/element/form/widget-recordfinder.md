# Record Finder

`recordfinder` - renders a field with details of a related record. Expanding the field displays a popup list to search large amounts of records. Supported by singular relationships only.

```yaml
user:
    label: User
    type: recordfinder
    list: ~/plugins/rainlab/user/models/user/columns.yaml
    recordsPerPage: 10
    title: Find Record
    nameFrom: name
    descriptionFrom: email
```

The following [field properties](../form-fields.md) are supported and commonly used.
